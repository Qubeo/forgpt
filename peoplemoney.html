About the Task Force The UN Secretary General established the Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) as part of his broader Roadmap for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:
2019-2021. The Task Forceâ€™s mandate is to recommend and catalyse ways to harness digitalization in accelerating
financing of the SDGs. The Task Forceâ€™s mandate, work and report are complementary to, and build on â€The Age of
Digital Interdependenceâ€™, that summarizes the findings and recommendations of the UN Secretary Generalâ€™s HighLevel
Panel on Digital Cooperation, and the associated Roadmap on Digital Cooperation. The Task Force is co-Chaired by Achim
Steiner and Maria Ramos. Its membership is Maiava Atalina Emma Ainuu-Enari, Henrietta H. Fore, Mats Granryd, Piyush

future, even amidst our efforts to deal with the tragedy, turmoil, and uncertainties thrust upon us during the current
crisis. Digital has proved to be a keystone in our handling of the crisis and will certainly emerge as a more important
part of our collective futures. With foresight, and fortuitously given todayâ€™s context, the UN Secretary General
mandated a task force to recommend how best to harness the forces of digitalization in accelerating financing of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are honoured to have been invited to co-Chair this task force, given both the
importance of its mandate, and the exceptional leaders drawn to its ambitious goals from governments and regulators,
financial, technology and international development communities. The nexus between digitalization, finance and the SDGs
is largely a new frontier of investigation and action. Fulfilling our mandate has therefore required us to catalyse a
knowledge ecosystem and a community of practice, as much as making recommendations. Core to the conclusions of the task
force is that digitalization amplifies the potential for the financial system to better serve the interests of people,
whose money it manages, and whose collective interest is expressed by the SDGs. Our Action Agenda, we believe, offers an
ambitious yet resolutely practical pathway for realising this potential, and closing the gap in financing the transition
to an inclusive, sustainable development. In conclusion, we would like to thank the UN Secretary General for the
opportunity to play a role in advancing his broader strategy for financing the SDGs, and to thank the members of the
Task Force for their extensive contributions, insights and conclusions reflected in this final report. Achim Steiner

DIFFERENT ACTORS 26 SECTIONS Contents 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Digitalization can propel us towards achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals, (SDGs). Our response to todayâ€™s unprecedented crisis demonstrates how digitalization can be
harnessed to support vulnerable people, reduce inequalities, sustain livelihoods and strengthen solidarity. If
unchecked, however, it could deepen exclusion, increase inequality and further divide us. Digital disruption creates an
historic opportunity to reshape finance. Mobile platforms and data analytics are bringing sophisticated financial
services to mass markets. Tens of millions of businesses depend on more than two billion people spending trillions of
dollars annually online. Governments are digitalizing public finance, and a growing portion of the worldâ€™s public
equities trades are executed by computer-managed funds. Digitalization can have a transformative impact by empowering
people in financing. The Task Force has focused on how digitalization can support financing that meets the priorities of
the people it is intended to serve, by empowering them as savers, lenders, borrowers, investors, and taxpayers. These
priorities are collectively represented by the SDGs, the shared agenda adopted by all United Nations Member States.
Catalytic opportunities can harness digitalization in aligning finance with the SDGs. The Task Force highlights that
digitalization is already making a difference, but that far more can be achieved by realising keystone, catalytic
opportunities. Notable is accelerating the use of domestic savings for long-term development, enhancing accountability
of public financing, making SDGs count in global financial markets, financing small and medium enterprises, and
promoting SDG-aligned consumer spending. Barriers and digital risks need to be overcome in harnessing digitalizationâ€™s
potential in financing the SDGs, with barriers including inadequate digital infrastructure, and access, affordability
and capabilities, and digital risks such as gender and minority biases, increased short-termism, cyber vulnerability,
and market concentration. Governance innovations are pre-conditions for harnessing digitalization in delivering
financing of the SDGs. Regulations and standards governing digital financing need to be informed by SDG commitments and
goals, with a particular need to ensure that the SDGs inform the governance of a new generation of global digital
financing platforms with cross-border, spillover impacts. The UN can play a key role in realizing opportunities,
overcoming barriers and mitigating risks in harnessing digitalization in financing the SDGs. Centrally is support to
Member States in realizing catalytic opportunities, aligning digitalized finance ecosystems with the SDGs, progressing
governance innovations to mitigate risks, and advancing digital financing in the UN. The historic opportunity to harness
digitalization in reshaping finance must be grasped now, given the urgency to finance the SDGs, the short window of
change resulting from a period of digital disruption, and the potential to maintain the digital momentum of the current
crisis. Executive Summary 8 Opportunity & Crisis HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY AMIDST UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS The long wave of
digitalization is changing the fundamentals of how we live. Today, over half the worldâ€™s population is online, a one
hundred-fold increase since 1990.2 Identities are formed, relationships maintained, and goods and services transacted
online.3 Tens of millions of businesses depend on digital markets, with an estimated 1.9 billion people purchasing goods
online in 2018.4 Digitalization is transforming finance, enabling services and markets to be automated, commoditized and
customized. Mobile platforms and data analytics are bringing sophisticated financial services to mass markets.5
Governments are digitalizing public finance,6 whilst a third of US public equities trades are executed by
computer-managed funds.7 Fintechpowered start-ups, financial service providers, and ecommerce, social media and search
platforms are all part of the disruptive wave.8 The Task Force has focused on how digitalization can support financing
that meets the priorities of people it is intended to serve. Citizens are the ultimate owners of the worldâ€™s income
and wealth, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect their collective priorities. Today, the world is awash
with finance, but it is not aligned with these priorities, due to gaps, weaknesses and distortions in institutions and
markets.10 z â€śDigital technologies are rapidly transforming society, simultaneously allowing for unprecedented
advances in the human condition and giving rise to profound new challenges.â€ť1 UN Secretary Generalâ€™s High-Level
Panel on Digital Cooperation 9 Opportunity & Crisis Digitalization offers an historic opportunity to overcome these
shortfalls in aligning a new generation of financing instruments, markets and institutional arrangements with the
SDGs.11 Without decisive action during this period of disruptive transition, however, digitalization could result in
finance becoming less rather than more aligned with sustainable development needs.12 â€ś[there is an urgent need to]
return the financial services industry to what it is supposed to be - an industry that serves people.â€ť Kristalina
Georgieva, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund9 Todayâ€™s unprecedented crisis has made digitalization far
more important. Digital finance has become a critical lifeline during the crisis for billions of people. Innovations and
investments have underpinned rapid scaling of support to vulnerable groups, from extending the reach of social safety
nets and health systems to new ways to secure digital livelihoods and undertake mutual support within families and
communities.13 This surge in the digital world amplifies the opportunity and the need for it to be harnessed in the
longer-term pursuit, and financing, of sustainable development. Success in building better beyond the crisis depends,
however, on overcoming emerging digital risks of a deepening divide, a loss of privacy, and increased cyber risks and
market concentration.14 This historic opportunity combined with this unprecedented crisis provides a unique moment and
imperative to act in harnessing digitalization to accelerate financing of the SDGs. Failure to act would be a wasted
opportunity and risk financeâ€™s divergence from the needs of citizens for an inclusive, sustainable development. Acting
with purpose and ambition, on the other hand, opens the possibility of overcoming barriers to securing financing for the
SDGs, whilst mitigating risks associated with digitalization of finance. * Throughout the report, the word
â€ścitizensâ€ť refers to worldâ€™s citizens and therefore does not exclude migrants or stateless persons. 10 Opportunity
& Crisis Exhibit 1: Task Force in Brief The Task Force has provided global leadership in helping to place sustainable
development at the heart of financeâ€™s disruptive, digital evolution. Comprising 17 leaders drawn from the financial,
technology, policy, regulatory and international development communities, the Task Force has been inspired and mandated
by the UN Secretary General15 and guided by the work of his High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation.16 Over 18 months,
the Task Force convened around the world, engaging in dozens of countries with hundreds of financial institutions,
governments and regulators, civil society organizations, think tanks and expert groups.17 GOAL Digital financing becomes
an integral part of sustainable development strategies Pathfinder initiatives advance digitally enabled SDGaligned
financing GOAL How best, and by whom, can the opportunities be realised, and risks mitigated? QUESTION QUESTION
Innovative governance harnesses digitalization in financing the SDGs GOAL QUESTION How will the digitalization of
financing reshape financial and monetary systems? GOAL Digital finance improves alignment of trillions of dollars of
financing with the SDGs GOAL Digital finance improves alignment of trillions of dollars of financing with the SDGs
MANDATE Recommend and catalyse ways to harness digitalization in accelerating financing of the SDGS How has the
digitalization already contributed to financing progress towards the SDGs? What are the barriers to realizing these
opportunities, and new risks associated with digitalization? QUESTION What are the digitally enabled opportunities for
financing the SDGs? QUESTION 11 Opportunity & Crisis The Task Force has catalysed a knowledge ecosystem at the nexus of
digitalization, finance, and sustainable development. Through its call for contributions and extensive literature
review, it has taken into account hundreds of papers, proposals and research pieces, as well as releasing papers,
op-eds, blogs and videos, including its progress report, â€Harnessing Digitalization to Finance the Sustainable
Development Goalsâ€™, on the occasion of the UN General Assembly in September 2019.18 The Task Forceâ€™s final report,
â€Peopleâ€™s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Futureâ€™, is summarized in this report. It
presents the main elements of the Task Forceâ€™s analysis, conclusions and recommendations, including how barriers and
risks might be overcome. It highlights who needs to do what in turning the recommendations into practice, exemplifying
ambitious action with a portfolio of pathfinder initiatives the Task Force has helped to catalyse. The full report
provides more depth across all of these elements, underpinned by an extensive, stand-alone bibliography. 12 Todayâ€™s
Digital Financing â€śMobilizing sufficient financing remains a major challenge in implementing the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Developmentâ€ť. 19 The gap does not arise from a lack of financial resources. Financing is not aligned with
the SDGs because of lack of data and standards, misaligned incentives and regulations, and gaps and weaknesses in
institutions and markets.20 Much is being done to overcome barriers to financing the SDGs, but we are still not on
course.21 The current crisis deepens the shortfall, despite the exceptional level of public spending on stimuli and
bailouts.22 Digitalization will make a difference if it helps to overcome barriers to financing the SDGs. 23 It can do
this through the combined and directed impacts of its three, essential features. More and better data which drives
better accounting of SDG-related risks and impacts in financial product design, financial decisions by private and
public financiers, and enhanced accountability. For example, it can improve the use of environmental data and increase
the consideration of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and disaster risks in financing decisions.24 Reduced
transaction and intermediation costs which enable broader access to financial services for groups that were previously
difficult and expensive to serve. For example, it can reduce the cost of cross-border transfers, loan origination and
other financial services to individuals and businesses through automating processes such as credit scoring and identity
validation.25 Innovative digital business models for financing of sustainability and for responding to the growing
demand by citizens concerned with SDG impacts.26 For example, it can underpin new business and market approaches that
enhance circularity, and facilitate shared and better use of capital, more distributed financing of infrastructure, and
wider access through innovative credit and payment approaches.27 Digitalizationâ€™s transformational potential is to
extend beyond financial inclusion in shaping a citizen-centric financial system. Citizens care about far more than
financial returns, with those wider concerns collectively expressed in the SDGs.28 Digitalization can help citizens in
directing the use of their money more effectively to realize their financial and non-financial goals, by delivering the
right information, improved access, greater accountability and smarter financial services, as shown in Exhibit 2.29
Greater citizen engagement in financial decision-making can be as individuals, e.g. as consumers, savers and investors,
and collectively, e.g. as pension and insurance policy holders, as members of associations and communities, and as
accounting agents â€“ taxpayers and voters. TODAYâ€™S DIGITAL FINANCING OF THE SDGS 13 Todayâ€™s Digital Financing â€˘
Digitalization has increased financial inclusion, helping hundreds of millions of women, rural residents, people on low
incomes, youth and small business owners to seamlessly transact, safely save, cheaply borrow, securely invest, and more
easily insure.31 Digitalization is already enabling many individuals and small businesses to gain access to financial
services, and we are seeing early signs of broader dimensions of digitally enabled financing of the SDG,30 as
highlighted in Exhibit 3. Digital public procurement Government payment solutions Open government data Supply chain

Citizens and digital financing of the SDGs 14 Todayâ€™s Digital Financing â€˘ Digitalization has helped to incorporate
SDG-related risks (sometimes termed â€environment, social and governanceâ€™ factors, or â€ESGâ€™) into growing volumes
of lending and investment, including climate-related risks most visibly in recent times, but also other environmental
and some social factors that present a material risk to financial returns.32 â€˘ Digitalization helps people align the
use of their money with their own interests and goals, as witnessed by the rapid growth in impact and automated
â€roboâ€™ investing, and the commensurate growth of SDG-aligned lending and investing opportunities.33 â€˘
Digitalization can empower citizens as taxpayers and users of public services through both ease and accessibility of tax
and payment systems for public services and greater transparency in the public allocation and use of funds.34 â€˘
Digitalization has enabled people to access capital-intensive services and optimize the use of their own assets, through
shared economy approaches such as product-as-a-service, smart metering, pay-as-you-go and rent-to-own.35 More and Better

Social Exhibit 3: Digitalization Supports Financing of the SDGs â€˘ There are significant barriers to advancing digital
financing, and risks associated with its emergence. Barriers include gaps in digital infrastructure and skills, and
backward-looking or slow-moving policy and regulation.36 Skills gaps, social norms and discrimination restrict womenâ€™s
access to and use of mobile technology and digital finance.37 In addition, there are risks that, if unmitigated, could
deepen the disconnect between finance and sustainable development. Digitalization opens new routes for breaches of
identity data, embezzlement and fraud.38 It can intensify short-termism,39 undermining long-term value creation, and it
may widen inequalities.40 The barriers and risks, as well as the opportunities, are heightened by the coronavirus
crisis. It deepens the damaging implications of being excluded from the digital world, and strengthens market power of
digital infrastructure platforms and digital marketplaces.41 Lack of basic access: 750 million people lack broadband
connectivity,42 1 billion lack formal IDs43 Capability gaps: illiteracy, poverty, social norms and lack of digital
capabilities hinder uptake in usage Access to appropriate digital financial services: lack of affordable, secure,
relevant digital financial services Patchy data to support financial decisionmaking and digital financing innovation,
particularly in relation to low-income countries Siloed and non-interoperable IT systems hinder use of data to price
risk, describe impacts and underpin accountability Talent shortage hinders digital financing innovation, particularly in
less developed countries Weak regulatory capabilities undermine the establishment of enabling policy and regulatory
environment for digital financing innovation Incumbent resistance to disruption, disintermediation, and digitally
enabled transparency of their activities and rewards Data security and privacy risks are amplified New fraud and money
laundering, for example on digital marketplaces, cryptocurrency exchanges, crowdfunding platforms Irresponsible digital
financial products with opaque or misleading terms and conditions and insufficient recourse mechanisms Data
monopolization or exploitative use of data can stifle future digital financing innovation and undermine consumer trust
Unfair treatment can arise from discriminatory algorithms based on biased data or hyperpersonalization of financial
services Short-termism, volatility trading and herd behaviour has grown with digitalization and algorithmic trading
Market concentration and rent taking derives from ever increasing returns to scale and growing complexity and opacity
Lack of, incomplete or over-regulation stifles market innovation Exhibit 4: Digital Financing â€“ Barriers and Risks
BARRIERS RISKS 16 Action Agenda Harnessing digitalization in advancing a citizen-centric financial system is the core of
the Task Forceâ€™s call to action to accelerate financing for the SDGs. The Call to Action is underpinned by an Action
Agenda comprising three linked sets of recommendations for actioning by market players, policy and regulatory
authorities, international organizations and other stakeholders. Catalytic opportunities are game-changing in both
delivering financing and shaping finance. The Task Force has highlighted the importance of advancing catalytic
opportunities for harnessing digitalization in aligning financing with the SDGs. Each can repurpose and redirect
significant financial flows towards financing the SDGs. Beyond this, they can be catalytic in triggering broader,
systemic changes by driving innovation, disrupting stagnant markets, undermining rent-taking, increasing accountability,
and encouraging governance innovations. Pathfinder initiatives developed through and with the Task Force exemplify how
to realize such catalytic opportunities. The Zimbabwean payments platform, EcoCash, has designed and piloted a
world-first stock exchange that draws on payments data to provide robust due diligence and credit ratings for
prospective listings, opening a debt and equity financing window for Zimbabwean SMEs operating in difficult economic
conditions. Bangladesh is exploring how to harness digitalization to channel domestic micro-savings into investments in
sustainable infrastructure, and then use blockchain to improve effectiveness and accountability in the use of funds.
Domestic savers could choose SDG projects from which they would benefit, the approach could deliver significant
reductions in the cost of capital, as well as economic multiplier effects as dividends flow to poorer Bangladeshi
citizens. Refinitiv, a Task Force knowledge partner, is aggregating 25 years of data on project finance, deals, loans,
due diligence, risk profiles, and macroeconomic, geopolitical and operational risk with ESG metrics to create a
comprehensive online view of over 60,000 infrastructure projects globally.44 The Task Force has identified five
catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalization in aligning financing with the SDGs. Taken together, they cover
much of global finance, from the vast pools flowing through global capital markets, to public finance that makes up a
major part of the global economy, to the aggregated potential of citizensâ€™ savings and consumer spending, and the
lifeblood financing for the employment and income-generating world of SMEs. These opportunities are systemically
important, but are by no means exhaustive, and are intended to inspire further work in identifying additional
opportunities. TASK FORCEâ€™S ACTION AGENDA ADVANCING CATALYTIC OPPORTUNITIES 17 Action Agenda Harnessing digitalization
in advancing a citizen-centric financial system is the core of the Task Forceâ€™s call to action to accelerate financing
for the SDGs. The Call to Action is underpinned by an Action Agenda comprising three, linked sets of recommendations for
actioning by market players, policy and regulatory authorities, international organizations and other stakeholders. â€˘
Advance catalytic opportunities to deliver financing for specific sustainable development goals. â€˘ Build foundations
for sustainable digital financing ecosystems, including: â€˘ Strengthen inclusive international governance to develop
policies, regulations, standards and corporate governance arrangements at the international level, suited for securing
SDG-aligned global digital financing platforms and markets. â€˘ Infrastructure: accessible, affordable connectivity,
digital ID and data markets. â€˘ Planning, institutions, and learning: developing national and in some cases regional
ecosystems that steer the evolution of SDG-aligned digital financing. â€˘ Capabilities: building peopleâ€™s capacity to
benefit from online connectivity and digital finance, ensuring rights and protections. Exhibit 5: Task Force Action

Channel domestic savings into development financing Global savings pool has grown over two decades from US$7.5 to
US$23.3 trillion. 45 Small savers and co-beneficiaries of sustainable infrastructure Policy makers should form national
coalitions with infrastructure, finance and payment platform businesses to build â€low-costhigh integrityâ€™ digital
financing solutions to enable micro-savers (including women and youth) to finance local, sustainable infrastructure.
Enhance financing for small and mediumsized businesses (SMEs) Potential to meet the US$5.2trillion a year need for SME
financing in developing countries.46 Borrowers, entrepreneurs, employees Policy makers and regulators should encourage
market innovation to develop SME lending and investment platforms, which integrate sustainability criteria and client
protections, and avoid algorithmic discrimination against women-owned businesses. Digitize public financing and make
public budgets and contracts transparent Governments in developing countries could gain US$220 to US$320 billion
annually from digitalizing payments.47 Tax-payers, voters, public service users Policy makers should make commitments
and work with civil society and the private sector to increase transparency of public finances and use open government
data to pursue SDG priorities. Embed SDGs into decisions financial and capital markets The outstanding value of global
equity and bond markets is US$185 trillion. 48 Savers, investors Regulators should set requirements for pension and
insurance companies to consult policyholders on the use of funds and publish stress tests of all material SDG-related
risks and impacts. Shape consumption decisions through improved information and choice architecture Annual global
consumption expenditure is US$47trillion. 49 Consumers, asset owners Policy makers should work with industry and provide
incentives to encourage and facilitate sustainable choices by consumers and enable digital markets for sustainable
assets. 19 Action Agenda (i) Universal, accessible, affordable connectivity and payments infrastructure, (ii) Reliable,
secure, private, unique digital IDs and, (iii) Data to inform individual, private and public financing decisions. (i)
Robust, dynamic planning of the financing needs associated with SDG priorities, (ii) Institutional mechanisms for
incentivizing the development of SDG-aligned digital financing, (iii) A framework for diagnosing, monitoring and
learning how the nexus between digital financing and SDGs is developing. (i) Legal rights to be consulted (e.g. as
pension and insurance policy holders), (ii) Protection of consumer rights, and against fraud, misuse, discrimination and
exploitation, (iii) Development of awareness and capabilities, individually but also crucially through collective
approaches (e.g. communities, associations, unions). Building core digital foundations made up of: Enabling digital
financing ecosystems to flourish made up of: Empowering people to use their finances by building their individual and
collective capability to impact financing decisions as consumers, savers, taxpayers, borrowers, investors and service
users, including: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE DIGITAL FINANCING ECOSYSTEMS Harnessing digitalization to empower people to
accelerate financing for the SDGs requires the development of the appropriate digital financing ecosystem. The Task
Force identifies necessary action in three areas:50 Task Force members and partners are accelerating digital financing
ecosystem development at national and regional levels through a series of pathfinder initiatives. In The Gambia,
EcoCash, UN Women and GSMA, with support from UNCDF, are strengthening the digital financing ecosystem by advancing a
supportive policy environment and promoting private sector investments in digital infrastructure and citizen-centric
products and services. The Central Bank of Kenya is working to foster a regional digital financing ecosystem, setting
the context for larger-scale adoption and development of sustainable digital financing innovations. The Green Digital
Finance Alliance, a Task Force knowledge partner, has developed a measurement framework that reviews the status of
digital and data infrastructure, policy and regulatory environment, and market applications that support financing for
SDGs.51 The framework will help shape policies and regulations that align digital financing solutions with national SDG
priorities, while generating knowledge about emerging sustainable digital financing practices. In undertaking this, the
promotion of digital and financial inclusion for women and other excluded groups should be a specific policy objective.

assessing the alignment of digital financing developments with SDG priorities. 1. Develop a coalition of citizen
representatives committed to ensuring citizen voice in decisions of financial intermediaries. 2. Financial regulators to
extend citizensâ€™ rights to information and involvement in financing decisions regarding the use of their money. 3.
Governments to reinforce their commitments to a goal of transparency of public finance, including budgets, procurement,
and spending, and provide roadmaps for achieving that goal. 4. Financial regulators and supervisory authorities to
develop strong consumer protection frameworks for digital financial services. 5. Central banks and financial supervisory
authorities to work with financial service providers and consumer protection groups to develop digital financial
literacy strategies. 1. Accelerate existing investment programs in digital infrastructure, particularly leveraging
COVID-19 stimulus-related learning and investments. 2. Converge on standards for a â€goodâ€™ digital ID and relevant
certification and safeguards. 3. Extend data governance discussions to a broader set of regulators, including financial,
telecom and data regulators, competition and tax authorities, and key market players. 4. Develop comprehensive data
privacy and protection legal frameworks. 5. Develop a country-based index that provides visibility on, and supports
systematic planning for, citizen-centric and open market 21 Action Agenda STRENGTHENING INCLUSIVE INTERNATIONAL
GOVERNANCE The UN Secretary Generalâ€™s High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation pointed to the need for stronger
international leadership and governance in building an inclusive digital economy and society; strengthening human and
institutional capacity; protecting human rights and agency; and ensuring trust, security, and stability.57 Building on
this landmark report, the UN Secretary General has issued a capitalise roadmap that describes how the United Nations can
support international digital cooperation in these areas.58 Aligned with the Roadmap on Digital Cooperation is the need
to strengthen the international governance of digital financing solutions to ensure they deliver financing for the SDGs.
International financial governance is a complex system of intergovernmental and regulatory coalitions and organizations
that together advance normative frameworks, standards, norms and performance metrics. The governance ecosystem has
increasingly incorporated the SDGs into their analysis and rule-setting, notably financial inclusion and more recently
climate action. Exemplifying this important development is the work of initiatives such as the Financial Stability
Boardâ€™s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,59 and the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for
Greening the Financial System,60 as well as national and regional initiatives, such as Chinaâ€™s framework for greening
its financial system61 and the European Commissionâ€™s International Platform on Sustainable Finance.62 Building on
these developments, the Task Force makes three recommendations that improve governance at the nexus of digital finance
and the broader agenda of financing the SDGs. A principles-based approach could advance international policy,
regulations and standards. Financial governance is informed by principles that cascade into frameworks, standards,
assessment models and metrics. A number of principles have been developed around inclusive digital finance (e.g. Bali
Fintech Agenda,63 G20â€™s Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion,64 Sochi Accord on Fintech for Financial
Inclusion,65 G20 AI Principles66 ) and sustainable finance (e.g. Principles for Responsible Investment,67 Principles for
Responsible Banking,68 Principles for Sustainable Insurance69). This work needs to be synthesized, expanded and
strengthened to establish a set of principles that can inform coherent norm-setting at the nexus of digital financing
and the SDGs. An inclusive approach, particularly involving developing nations, could enhance the governance of global
digital financing platforms with cross-border sustainable development impacts. Digitalization drives increasing returns
to scale and is likely to lead to increased market concentration and globally significant digital finance platforms.70
Their cross-border spill-over impacts may be intended and beneficial or problematic depending on country characteristics
such as the level of private and financial sector development.71 Current regulatory discussions and practice concerning
these global digital finance platforms have been limited in scope and participation, albeit incorporating windows of
public consultations.72 Corporate governance innovations can ensure that SDG considerations are taken into account.
Regulatory oversight of digital financing platforms needs to adapt, but it could also be complemented by corporate
governance innovation. Some digital companies are already experimenting in soft or non-fiduciary governance innovations
to secure public interest outcomes.73 Building on and amplifying these early experiences, the development of more
systematic â€public utilityâ€™ corporate governance arrangements could complement policy and regulatory measures in
strengthening the SDG-alignment of global digital financing platforms. 22 Action Agenda Task Force members have convened
a Dialogue on Global Digital Finance to facilitate inclusive discussion and rule-setting on digital financing platforms
with cross-border effects. Under the leadership of Kenya and Switzerland, the international Dialogue on Global Digital
Finance seeks to facilitate a balanced and more inclusive dialogue, particularly involving developing nations, on
SDG-aligned governance of global digital finance platforms. It will convene regulators from various domains and
representatives from key institutions to advance governance innovations and policy responses to evolving global digital
finance, appropriate for developing economies. The Task Forceâ€™s recommendations help in addressing barriers and risks.
There are barriers and risks in harnessing digitalization, which left unattended could worsen the misalignment of
financing with the SDGs. The recommendations in the Task Forceâ€™s Action Agenda help to address many of these barriers
and risks. Some may however remain less impacted in implementing the recommendations, from the growing problem of online
fraud74 to cross-border issues such as taxing digital services,75 aspects of illicit financial flows,76 and the
challenges of effective regulation of high-speed, automated financial market trading.77 There remains much to be done,
with key action areas and practical steps highlighted by the UN Secretary Generalâ€™s Roadmap on Digital Cooperation.78
Element Recommendation Next Steps Principles Inclusive Rule-Setting Governance Innovations Develop a set of principles
that guide national and international rulemaking and also directly market behaviour in aligning digital financing with
the SDGs. UN with Bretton Woods institutions to advance such a set of principles in consultation between policy makers,
regulators, international organizations, fintech companies and financial institutions, draw on existing principles (e.g.
Bali Fintech Agenda) and to be adopted by key international platforms, such as the G20. Ensure a more effective,
permanent voice of developing countries in the development of governance of digital financing, particularly pertaining
to global digital finance platforms that will have cross-border spill-over impacts. Establish a platform led by
developing country policymakers and regulators to engage with international rule and standard-setting bodies shaping the
next generation of governance of global digital financing acttors. It should leverage existing platforms for developing
country engagement with standard setters and include finance, telecommunications, competition, tax and data regulators.
Develop and deploy corporate governance frameworks to secure â€public utilityâ€™ aspects of digital finance platforms
that are large, market dominant, and have cross-border spill-over effects. Establish a working group including financial
policy makers and regulators, corporate governance groups, public interest bodies and global digital finance platforms
to develop and encourage take up of possible frameworks. Exhibit 8: Inclusive International Governance 23 Action Agenda
Increased investment in digital foundations will help overcome access barriers, enhance data availability and increase
citizen participation in financing decisions. Specific consideration of data access, usage and sharing in the design of
robust digital foundations, will help mitigate data privacy and data monopolization risks. Advancing digital financing
ecosystems will ease the development of relevant innovations, increasing citizen interest and agency. Regional
approaches to these ecosystems will drive partnerships, knowledge exchange and support local talent development.
Development of local regulatory and supervisory tools and capabilities, as part of advancing digital financing
ecosystems, will address new risks such as algorithmic biases and unfair treatment. Advancing digital financing
ecosystems will drive innovation that undermines rent-taking. International cooperation in inclusive governance and
policy dialogue will help build regulatory capabilities and support innovation in digital financing. International
cooperation in governance will help address risks such as data monopolization and advance solutions to systemic risks,
such as cybersecurity, posed by large platforms through greater dialogue and information sharing on threats. Pursuing
catalytic opportunities will result in increased innovation, disruption, disintermediation and transparency, potentially
helping to overcome incumbent resistance. Pursuing catalytic opportunities will redirect significant financial flows
towards long-term sustainable investments, away from shorttermism. It will also drive innovation that undermines
rent-taking. Empowering citizens, individually and collectively, by advancing digital financial literacy programs,
access to information, and increased transparency, including addressing barriers for specific groups such as women and
older people, will drive greater usage of digital financial services and citizen involvement in financing decisions.
Securing citizen rights and capabilities and ensuring adequate protection mechanisms will contribute to reducing fraud
and building trust. Furthermore, this will strengthen citizensâ€™ role as accountability agents, which will contribute
to curbing such risks as short-termism and volatility trading. Exhibit 9: Action Agenda Helps Overcome Barriers and
Risks OVERCOMING BARRIERS ADDRESSING RISKS 24 Implementing the Task Forceâ€™s Action Agenda can close the gap in
financing the SDGs. The Action Agenda sets out how digitalization can be harnessed to deliver the financing needed by
investing in digital infrastructure, encouraging market development, empowering citizens and enabling the necessary
governance innovations. Implementing the Action Agenda will undoubtedly be a challenge. The call is for systemic changes
in finance, citizensâ€™ capabilities and the practice of institutional innovations. Digitalization and its disruptive
effects open the way to this systemic change, if guided to overcome barriers, avoid risks, and seize SDG-aligned
opportunities. The current health and economic crisis related to COVID-19 increases the challenge of addressing
long-term needs. At the same time, its impact in accelerating all aspects of digitalization may ultimately make it
easier to implement the Action Agenda. Every country can and should advance digitally enabled, citizen-centric financing
of the SDGs. The Call to Action and Action Agenda are ambitious and achievable and are relevant to all countries.
Specific aspects and focus areas, however, depend on national priorities, the maturity of digital infrastructure, public
financing and financial markets, capabilities and financial governance arrangements. There is a sequencing dependent on
a countryâ€™s stage of development: Less developed countries might focus on building affordable digital infrastructure,
developing digital skills, providing secure digital IDs, and ensuring access to core financial services. Countries that
have these foundations in place might place more emphasis on secure savings, SME borrowing and more transparent and
efficient public finance and tax collection. Countries with significant pools of domestic savings might emphasize new
channels for aggregating savings to be used for longer term sustainable development financing. Countries with
sophisticated financial and capital markets might prioritize improved risk pricing, impact investing, and
operationalizing the rights of shareholders and pension policyholders in shaping investment policies. Whilst the basic
digital infrastructure needs to be in place, less developed countries can without doubt harness catalytic opportunities
in leapfrogging to more sophisticated, impactful financing arrangements. For example, it is demonstrably possible to
harness digitalization to connect domestic savings to infrastructure investment in the face of weak or absent capital
markets, and leverage data from payment platforms to advance algorithmic lending to SMEs, or digital approaches to
developing stock exchanges. Next Steps NEXT STEPS 25 Finally, the UN should develop a mechanism for stewarding the
implementation of the Task Forceâ€™s recommendations. 01 02 03 By advancing sustainability-aligned digital financing
solutions at the country and regional levels. By building out inclusive international governance, focused in particular
on advancing appropriate governance principles and more inclusive policy and regulatory development. By exemplifying
good practice in transparency and accountability of its own finances including those it channels to activities in Member
States. Empowering people in financial decision-making will not happen automatically. The detachment of public and
private finance from citizens has become an embedded feature of global finance.79 There is much to do in overcoming the
resistance of those who are sceptical or cynical about citizens being agents of change, or who have vested interests in
the status quo. Citizens need capabilities and education to make informed decisions. Inclusion will not happen
automatically. Decision makers should consider the particular barriers for women, older people, youth and other excluded
groups. Policymakers and regulators will need to secure the right data flows, and the rights and opportunities for
citizens to shape financing decisions. Market actors have a key role to play in empowering citizens by offering
specialized products and services. Ambitious action requires connecting the dots between several communities across
public and private actors. Policymakers and regulators, and market and civil society actors will have to work together
to realize the catalytic opportunities, build sustainable digital financing ecosystems, and foster international
cooperation and governance innovations. Advocates of sustainable finance need to get more digital.80 Digital finance
innovation communities and data providers need to get more savvy about sustainable development.81 Financial regulators
need to place more emphasis on the SDGs82 and to cooperate closer with policy-makers and non-financial regulators,
including those responsible for data, taxation, competition policy and telecommunications.83 Exemplary initiatives,
including those the Task Force has catalysed, illustrate potential. The Task Force has identified many relevant and
inspiring use cases as part of its landscape mapping 84 and has highlighted some of these in its report. It has also
catalysed a small portfolio of pathfinder initiatives that exemplify ambitious and innovative projects aligned with its
Action Agenda. Collectively, these initiatives demonstrate how key features of digitalization - more and better data,
cheaper transactions and financial intermediation, and innovative digital business models - could be harnessed toward
financing sustainable development by giving citizens more options to make informed and purposeful decisions. The United
Nations has a key role to play in implementing the Action Agenda. The UN supports Member States in implementing the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. As part of this, there are three ways in which the UN can advance the Task Forceâ€™s
Action Agenda. Next Steps 26 Technical assistance and disseminating learning, supporting governance innovation. Provide
support for development of inclusive infrastructure and the capacity of citizens Exhibit 10: The Action Agenda for
Different Actors Policy makers and regulators Member states, as part of the UN system Fintech companies and global
digital platforms International development community Development finance institutions Civil society organisations The
United Nations Financial Institutions Provide standards and regulatory certainty, advance cooperation with innovators,
steer market development in support of national sustainable development priorities, empower citizens and mitigate risks
brought by digitalization of finance. Cooperate to share experience, coordinate and advance ambition and develop common
principles and approaches, while building capacity, infrastructure, regulations and industry support at home. Innovate
products and services which meet consumer demand to channel finance to sustainable development goals. Commit to
principles of SDG-aligned digital financing and develop corporate governance mechanisms to ensure they operationalize
them. Identify and advance opportunities in own products and systems, advance interoperable digital ID and data systems.
Engage with international standard setting and explore corporate governance options for stewarding the SDGs. Offer
solutions to share risk to enable the development of catalytic solutions. Share knowledge to help governments design
risk capital projects aligned to sustainable development and provide incentives via conditionality for corporate

citizens.z Support Member States in realizing catalytic opportunities and establishing digital financing ecosystems
aligned with SDG priorities. Advance inclusive international norm-setting and governance innovations to mitigate risks.
Exemplify good practice on digital financing internally. Develop a mechanism for stewarding the implementation of Task
Force recommendations. ACTORS KEY ROLES Next Steps 27 EPILOGUE Multiple crises and uncertainties characterize the
unprecedented state of the world as the Task Force completes its work. Human tragedy; the fears of a volatile,
indefinite health crisis; the implosion of local and national economies with resulting unemployment, poverty and
inequality; an extraordinary scale of fiscal and monetary stimuli by those countries that can afford them, and a public
finance and sovereign debt crisis for those who cannot. Amidst such turmoil, the persistent and growing threats of
climate change and biodiversity loss; and the challenges in securing the national, regional and international
cooperation needed to come through this period and build better, with dignity, humanity and hope. Digitalization,
already part of our world, has through this crisis come into its own. Over 1.5 billion children in 188 countries have
been affected by school closures due to the pandemic, with many resorting to some form of online learning.85 Digital
finance in particular has become a lifeline for many, and the positive hotspot of a global economy on pause.86 Digital
rails have become the superhighways for large cash transfers by governments to citizens in the face of income losses
associated with mandatory lockdowns.87 Online shopping has surged through the crisis, with many surveys pointing to a
permanent shift in consumer behaviour towards digital purchases.88 Customer spending through Amazon has surged during
the crisis to US$11,000 per second, driving the value of the Seattle-based company up to almost US$1.2 trillion.89
Alibaba, which emerged as Chinaâ€™s leading ecommerce platform after the 2003 SARS outbreak, is now offering billions of
dollars in loans to SMEs at a time when many others are retrenching.90 z The coronavirus crisis and its economic
aftermath have not created but have without doubt super-charged the trends towards digitalization. In this context, the
Task Forceâ€™s mandate and recommendations are more important than ever and represent a more urgent agenda to action.
Epilogue 28 Catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalization to accelerate financing for the SDGs have never been
greater. Many governments have committed to greener and more equitable, short term public stimuli and bailouts, and
longer-term recovery plans, driving impact-focused public spending and investments that will require enhanced
transparency and accountability underpinned by real-time, digital tagging and assessment.91 Sustainability-aligned
investments in public traded equities have performed remarkably well throughout the crisis, and are expected to grow
rapidly, requiring better data and improved financial products.92 SME access to finance will be a critical factor in the
short and longer-term recovery, with algorithmic lending providing an ever-more important basis for targeting and moving
funds quickly and safely.93 Digital risks will also be more present than ever before. Access to a phone, a bank account
and a digital ID is increasingly core to economic health and for some a matter life or death. Yet one or more parts of
this digital survival kit are still unavailable to almost half the adult population, disproportionately women, across
most developing countries.94 The rapid digitalization of public finance makes the need more urgent for robust systems,
strong institutions and effective accountability.95 Cybersecurity and privacy threats represent a growing concern, often
affecting the most vulnerable with less advanced capabilities.96 The accelerated growth of digital financing and global
platforms, makes it more pressing to secure the international cooperation and governance innovations needed to ensure
that their global, cross-border effects benefit communities in delivering SDG-aligned outcomes.97 Epilogue Fintech
